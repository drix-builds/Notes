## cracks overview
- they work on assembly, basically looking at the code that runs at the most base level and seeing what it does
- like once you look at the assembly code you can look for specific actions that are being sent to the CPU
- such as jump codes ie: jne (jump if not equal) or je (jump if equal)
- search for the "incorrect password" string or whatever error code you get when entering incorrect credentials on the program
- change the neccesarry code in order to jump to the successful branch
